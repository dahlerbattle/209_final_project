          <h2>Are vaccinations safe?</h2>
          According to the CDC, as of December 1st, 2021, 40% of the US population is not fully vaccinated.
          There is much debate over the efficacy and safety of the vaccine itself,
          so we offer the opportunity to explore some of the more controversial and
          misunderstood data to
          objectively explore the dangers of COVID-19 against the possible
          dangers of the vaccine.
          <br>
          <br>
          We'll look at three separate datasets in this exploration. To view covid
          deaths, we'll use the
          <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Week-Sex-and-Age/vsak-wrfu"
            target="_blank">CDC's COVID-19 Deaths by Week, Sex, and Age</a> dataset, and
          to take a deep dive into vaccination rates, we'll use the
          <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc/data"
              target="_blank">CDC's COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States</a> dataset.
          We chose the CDC data because it is the most objective and vetted vaccination record
          and COVID-19 deaths record available.
          To explore alleged adverse effects from the vaccine, we'll use the
          <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html"
              target="_blank">US Dept of Health & Human Services Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)</a> dataset.
          It's worth noting that the VAERS dataset is not new- it's been around since 1990
          to be used as an early indicator for any potentially dangerous vaccination
          side effects, and it is a completely voluntary system, so we would expect
          some bias and innacuracies in the data. We absolutely encourage you to
          read the disclaimer on their
          website to understand the limitations of the dataset.
          <br>
          <br>
          Even with these limitations in the dataset, we chose to explore VAERS because
          it's been widely touted as proof that the vaccine is indeed dangerous. Not
          ones to take another's word for it, we decided to dig in on our own, and share
          our findings with you!
          <br><br>

          <h2>COVID-19 Deaths vs Vaccine Deaths</h2>
          In the visualizations below, we compare the number of US COVID-19 deaths
          against the entire US population- not just those who have gotten sick. This
          allows us to look at a person's changes of both contracting AND dying of COVID-19,
          since not every individual will contract COVID and many non-symptomatic cases will
          go undetected.
          Bearing that in mind, please continue reading to compare the vaccine
          symptoms against the percent of the population that has died from COVID-19.

                the number grows. That's why our cumulative value is able to drop.

            <p>Let's take a look at which symptoms were most commonly reported. The
            crossfilter chart explores most common symptoms across manufacturer,
            dosage series, severity, and age range. You can filter across multiple variables
            by clicking and dragging your mouse across the columns that you would
            like to filter further. For example, if you click and drag over "Moderna"
            and "Dose 2" on the first two plots you should that the most common
            symptom is pyrexia, or a fever.

            <p> Lastly, we'll look at the symptoms breakdown in the VAERS dataset
            against published CDC data. The figure on the right (or below, depending your screen layout)
             is from a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.10.21264827v2.full-text"
             target="_blank">MedRxiv preliminary report </a> regarding booster vaccinations.
             It shows symptoms reported 7 days following a booster from a given manufacturer
             given a primary vaccination from a given manufacturer (not necessarily the
             same manufacturer as the booster). Row A shows symptoms reported by individuals
             that received the mRNA-1273 booster and are split into 3 charts based on the
             primary vaccination received prior to the booster. Similarly, Row B and Row C
             show symptoms reported by individuals that received the Ad26.COV2.S and
             BNT162b2 booster respectively. For clarity, the vaccination manufacturers
             are as follow:
             <br>
             <br>
              <li>mRNA-1273 = Moderna </li>
              <li>Ad26.COV2.S = Janssen</li>
              <li>BNT162b2 = Pfizer/BioNTech</li>
              <br>
            Symptoms were graded as mild (does not interfere with activity), moderate (interferes
             with activity), or severe (prevents daily activity).
             <br>
             <br>
            This figure is provided as a comparison and reference for the left or top (depending
            on layout) visualization of top symptoms from each manufacturer reported from the VAERS
            dataset. Though this figure looks at symptoms from a booster shot rather than from
            the primary vaccination regimen, it is provided to show that primary symptoms reported
            between the VAERS data and CDC vetted data are comparable. Furthermore it confirms the
            results from the VAERs symptom visualization that primary reactions are mild and non-life-threatening.  </p>
