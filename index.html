          <h2>Are vaccinations safe?</h2>
          As of December 1st, 2021, 40% of the US population is not fully vaccinated.
          There is much debate over the efficacy and safety of the vaccine itself,
          so we offer the opportunity to explore some of the more concerning data and
          objectively explore the dangers of COVID-19 against the possible
          dangers of the vaccine.
          <br>
          <br>
          We'll look at three separate datasets in this exploration. To view covid
          deaths, we'll use the
          <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Week-Sex-and-Age/vsak-wrfu"
            target="_blank">CDC's COVID-19 Deaths by Week, Sex, and Age</a> dataset,
          to take a deep dive into vaccination rates, we'll use the
          <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc/data"
              target="_blank">CDC's COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States</a> dataset,
          and to explore alleged adverse effects from the vaccine, we'll use the
          <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html"
              target="_blank">US Dept of Health & Human Services Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)</a> dataset.
          It's worth noting that the VAERS dataset is not new- it's been around since 1990
          to be used as an early indicator for any potentially dangerous vaccination
          side effects, and it is a completely voluntary system. Any individual could
          falsely report an adverse reaction, and that false information would forever
          stay in the database. We absolutely encourage you to read the disclaimer on their
          website to understand the limitations of the dataset.
          <br>
          <br>
          Even with these limitaions in the dataset, we chose to explore VAERS because
          it's been widely touted as proof that the vaccine is indeed dangerous. Not
          ones to take another's word for it, we decided to dig in on our own, and share
          our findings with you!
          <br>

          <h2>COVID-19 Deaths vs Vaccine Deaths</h2>
          In the visualizations below, we compare the number of US COVID-19 deaths
          against the entire US population- not just those who have gotten sick.
          Bearing that in mind, please continue reading to compare the vaccine
          symptoms against the percent of the population that has died from COVID-19.
